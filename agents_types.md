# 🤖 Agent Types in Artificial Intelligence

Agents can be divided into **five basic types** based on how intelligent they are perceived to be and how well they can interact or adapt to their environment.

---

## 1. Simple Reflex Agents

- **How it works**: Acts only based on the current situation using predefined rules.
- **Memory**: ❌ No memory
- **Goal Awareness**: ❌ No
- **Learning**: ❌ No
- **Example**: A **thermostat** that turns on heating if the temperature is below 20°C.

---

## 2. Model-Based Reflex Agents

- **How it works**: Uses internal memory (model) to remember past inputs and infer the current state.
- **Memory**: ✅ Yes
- **Goal Awareness**: ❌ No
- **Learning**: ❌ No
- **Example**: A **robotic vacuum** that remembers where it has already cleaned.

---

## 3. Goal-Based Agents

- **How it works**: Chooses actions that move it closer to a defined goal.
- **Memory**: ✅ Yes
- **Goal Awareness**: ✅ Yes
- **Learning**: ❌ No
- **Example**: A **GPS app** that finds the best route to your destination.

---

## 4. Utility-Based Agents

- **How it works**: Considers multiple goals and selects actions that provide the best **utility** (benefit).
- **Memory**: ✅ Yes
- **Goal Awareness**: ✅ Yes
- **Learning**: ❌ No
- **Example**: An **online shopping app** that recommends products based on preferences and budget.

---

## 5. Learning Agents

- **How it works**: Learns from experience and improves its performance over time.
- **Memory**: ✅ Yes
- **Goal Awareness**: ✅ Yes
- **Learning**: ✅ Yes
- **Example**: A **spam filter** that learns from user behavior or a **self-driving car** that improves with experience.
